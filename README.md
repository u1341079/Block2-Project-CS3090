# Google Forms to Trello Google App Script

This repository contains Google App Script to send responses from a Google Form to Trello. This allows the user to automatically create Trello cards for each response made from the associated Google form. 

To use this code, create a Trello Board and Google Form. Once created, go to the Google Form and create a linked Google Sheet. Within the Google Sheet, go to Extensions then click App Scripts. Use this starter code and follow the additional instructions in the code to put in your Trello token and key.
